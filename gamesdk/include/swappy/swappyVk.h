/**
 * @brief Determine any Vulkan device extensions that must be enabled for a new
 * VkDevice.
 *
 * Swappy-for-Vulkan (SwappyVk) benefits from certain Vulkan device extensions
 * (e.g. VK_GOOGLE_display_timing).  Before the application calls
 * vkCreateDevice, SwappyVk needs to look at the list of available extensions
 * (returned by vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties) and potentially identify
 * one or more extensions that the application must add to:
 *
 * - VkDeviceCreateInfo::enabledExtensionCount
 * - VkDeviceCreateInfo::ppEnabledExtensionNames
 *
 * before the application calls vkCreateDevice.  For each VkPhysicalDevice that
 * the application will call vkCreateDevice for, the application must call this
 * function, and then must add the identified extension(s) to the list that are
 * enabled for the VkDevice.  Similar to many Vulkan functions, this function
 * can be called twice, once to identify the number of required extensions, and
 * again with application-allocated memory that the function can write into.
 *
 * @param[in]    physicalDevice          - The VkPhysicalDevice associated with the
 *                    available extensions.
 * @param[in]    availableExtensionCount - This is the returned value of
 *                    pPropertyCount from vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties.
 * @param[in]    pAvailableExtensions    - This is the returned value of
 *                    pProperties from vkEnumerateDeviceExtensionProperties.
 * @param[inout] pRequiredExtensionCount - If pRequiredExtensions is nullptr, the
 *                    function sets this to the number of extensions that are
 *                    required.  If pRequiredExtensions is non-nullptr, this
 *                    is the number of required extensions that the function
 *                    should write into pRequiredExtensions.
 * @param[inout] pRequiredExtensions - If non-nullptr, this is application-allocated
 *                    memory into which the function will write the names of
 *                    required extensions.  It is a pointer to an array of
 *                    char* strings (i.e. the same as
 *                    VkDeviceCreateInfo::ppEnabledExtensionNames).
